It is specially intended to find emails and phone numbers that are obfuscated in order to avoid spam.
The program is modularized in such a way that is easy to use your own patterns to discover emails and phone numbers, and adding new ones can be done by just 
adding new lines with regular expressions to our patterns file.
The program is written in the file 'email_phone_parser.py'. Instructions for the usage are giving when '-h' or '--help' are given in the arguments.
